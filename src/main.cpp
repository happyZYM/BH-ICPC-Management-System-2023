/**
 * @file main.cpp
 *
 * @brief this is the main code of ICPC-Management-System
 *
 * @details In the function main(), the program will read the input data and
 * call the APIs. Then the APIs will call the detailed functions to do the real
 * work.
 *
 * @codesytle This file is written in a sytle mainly based on Google C++ Style
 * Guide. What's sepecial is the comment:
 * 1. Multi-line comments are always before the code they comment on.
 * Usually the code they comment on is a complex procedure,like the definition
 * of a function,a class or a variable with complex operation. If a multi-line
 * comment is in one line, it will start with "/*" instead of "/**",otherwise it
 * will start with "/**" and in the format of Doxygen.
 * 2. Single-line comments are always after the code they comment on.
 * Usually they are in the same line with the code they comment on,but sometimes
 * they may come in the next lines. single-line comments shouldn't exceed 3
 * lines as they are intended to be short and easy to understand.
 * 3. Temporary disabled code will be marked with "//" in the front of each
 * 4. Some comments have special meanings,like "//TODO", "//FIXME", "//XXX","//
 * clang-format off" and "// clang-format on". They are not controlled by the
 * previous rules.
 *
 * As I use Clang-format to format my code, so the code style may be a little
 * bit strange sometimes, in the case I'll manually format the code.
